Being very new to python and very new to AI i thought i would use open ai to help me write my fist python program
This took me about 90 minutes
I had alerady installed python before starting
my chat session is here https://chat.openai.com/share/fea96f69-70ab-4e11-822c-b79ec8503547

Im quite pleased with the results

learnings
open ai does not really know how to solve a moderate coding challange considerable without human help
The fact that i have many many years of coding java, c#, javascript, node made it easy to ask the ai how to do what i needed to do
I didnt use any other online resources

Admission
Im not a total newb at python, i have read and code reviewed many scripts, but some how i have never actually written a program that actually does anything.
